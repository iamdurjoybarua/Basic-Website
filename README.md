# Basic Webpage with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This repository contains the foundational code for a simple webpage built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for basic interactivity. It's designed to be a clear and straightforward example for individuals learning the fundamentals of web development.

## Contents

* `index.html`: The main HTML file defining the structure and content of the webpage.
* `styles.css`: An external stylesheet containing the CSS rules for styling the webpage elements.
* `script.js`: A JavaScript file with basic interactive functionality.

## Getting Started

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd basic-website
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.** You can simply double-click the file or right-click and choose "Open with..." followed by your preferred browser.
